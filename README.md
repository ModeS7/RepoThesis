# Thesis
README file for the master's thesis of Anna Milde Bekkevoll. This repository is divided into Generation and Segmentation folders. 

The Generation folder includes the code used for training the diffusion models, and for sampling synthetic data from the trained models. Code for the metrics used to evaluate the generated
images is also found in this folder. This includes code for finding FID, IS and MS-SSIM / SSIM values. 

The Segmentation foldes includes code for the training of the segmentation model used for the different segmentation experiments. Also a performance file is included that was used to test the model performance after training.
